  message: If the application declares explicitly or uses any of the feature provided
    by the Spring `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` component,. then check if there is a Quarkus
    Extensions with Spring API compatibility for the Spring `{{artifact}}` component..
    If yes, then replace the `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` dependency with the Quarkus
    extension.. If no, consider rewrite the code that relies on this dependency leveraging
    the Quarkus Guides linked below.. Otherwise, if the application hasn't got this
    explicit Spring `{{group}}:{{artifact}}` component dependency, it has been added
    transitively by another Spring component.. Once the dependant Spring component
    will be removed, this issue will be fixed as well.
